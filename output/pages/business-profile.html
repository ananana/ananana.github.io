    <h1>Business profile</h1>
    

    <p>I have been working as a freelance software developer for the past 8 years, during
which I have both consulted clients and built software for them to solve their
NLP and machine learning related problems. During this time I have worked
both as part of a team and autonomously, both on novel problems requiring
sophisticated solutions, and on building the applications around them, from
designing the solution, to implementing, deploying and maintaining it, and
training other team members to use it.</p>
<p>As an on-site developer, I worked as a (research) software engineering intern for Google Zurich, and as machine learning intern for Amazon Development Centre Scotland, where I had the opportunity to further learn about what it is to do machine learning to improve a product on which millions of users rely,
working with huge amounts of data.</p>
<h4>Skills</h4>
<p>Natural language processing, machine learning, data science - both
professional and research experience.</p>
<p>I have some experience with computer vision and image processing.</p>
<p>I have experience with web-related software development, including:
scraping, backend web development, building web services.</p>
<p>I have worked mostly on linux-based platforms, have worked with
cloud-based platforms such as AWS/EC2. I am comfortable with
bash and some administration of my own servers.</p>
<h4>Programming languages</h4>
<p>The language I enjoy using and have most experience with is python, I have some
experience with Java, C++, bash.</p>
<h4>Frameworks and libraries</h4>
<p>Frameworks and libraries in the python ecosystem related to NLP/ML:
Tensorflow, Apache MXNet, PyTorch, scikit-learn, NLTK</p>
<p>Frameworks and libraries related to web development and scraping:
scrapy, Flask, sqlalchemy</p>
<p>OpenCV for image processing.</p>

Hi, I'm Ana.

I am a software developer and research scientist, specializing in natural language processing and machine learning.

I am always looking for interesing projects to work on,
either for [business](/pages/business-profile.html) or for pleasure ([research](/pages/academic-profile.html)), so if you
would like to collaborate - write me an email! âž™
